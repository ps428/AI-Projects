            Analyze the pull request changes and update all CLAUDE.md files in the repository to reflect these changes.

            IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
            1. First, use glob search to find all CLAUDE.md files in the repository (search for "**/CLAUDE.md")
            2. Examine the pull request that triggered this workflow:
               - Get the PR diff to understand all changes
               - Identify which areas/features were changed
               - Review the PR description and title for context
            3. For each CLAUDE.md file found, determine if it needs updating based on:
               - The commit message description
               - The files that were changed
               - The nature of the changes
            4. Update ONLY the relevant sections - do not rewrite entire files
            5. Preserve the existing structure and formatting of each CLAUDE.md file

            Focus on updating:
            - Architecture descriptions if structural changes were made
            - Development tools/scripts if package.json or build configs changed
            - API documentation if endpoints or interfaces changed
            - Component descriptions if new components were added or modified
            - Configuration instructions if config files changed
            - Any outdated information that no longer matches the codebase

            For monorepo projects:
            - Update the root CLAUDE.md if changes affect shared/core functionality
            - Update package-specific CLAUDE.md files only if changes affect that package
            - Consider the directory structure when determining which CLAUDE.md to update

            After updating, create a pull request with:
            - Title: "chore: auto-update CLAUDE.md files based on PR #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}"
            - Description listing:
              - Which CLAUDE.md files were updated
              - What sections were modified in each file
              - Brief summary of why each update was necessary
              - Reference to the pull request that triggered these updates: #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
            - Label the PR with "documentation" if available

            DO NOT update the documentation if:
            - The changes are trivial (like fixing typos in comments)
            - The changes don't affect the documented behavior or structure
            - The CLAUDE.md files already accurately reflect the current state
            - The PR only modifies test files or CI/CD configurations (unless those are documented)
            - The PR is itself updating CLAUDE.md files (to avoid infinite loops)
